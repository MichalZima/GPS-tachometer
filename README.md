This is my first project on github and also first time I am working with git and github.

My project is GPS tracking device, with a mobile app, wich visualize data from device.
This device was made as bicycle tachometer but you can use it for basically anything from running to flying, because the measuring is done with GPS

I made device with arduino and it's components are:
	- measuring Speed, Distance (total and per day/session), Height above sea level, Climbing (total and per day/session), wich is all printed on devices display
	- measuring  Lattitude and Longitude to draw our route to a map in mobile app
			
Device is not finished yet but I have functional prototype.

Now I am working on app and I'll finish the device later
